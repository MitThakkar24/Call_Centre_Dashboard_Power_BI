### KPI Rquirement

-> Total Number of Calls: track and display the total number of calls received by our call center over a specified period.

-> Total Call Duration in Hours: It is crucial to understand the total amount of time call center staff spend on calls in hours, which can help us in resource allocation and capacity planning 

-> Total Call Duration in Minutes : Similar to the total call duration in hours, this KPI provides the total call time but in minutes, offering more granular view of call durations.

-> Average Call Duration in Minutes: To assess the efficiency of our agents, we need to calculate and display the average call duration in minutes. This metric can help identify trends in call handling.
